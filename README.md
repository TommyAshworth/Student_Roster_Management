🧾 Student Roster System | C++
📌 Scenario
You were contracted by a university to help migrate an existing student information system to a new platform using C++. Your task involved designing and implementing part of the system that reads and manipulates structured student data.

🛠️ Technologies & Concepts Used
C++

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Data Parsing

Dynamic Memory Management

Custom Classes

Console I/O

📚 Requirements Overview
The system is built using two main classes:

Student: Holds attributes like ID, name, email, age, course durations, and degree program.

Roster: Manages a class roster and provides functionality to interact with student data.

The application:

Parses student data from a structured dataset

Dynamically creates and stores Student objects

Maintains an array of students (classRosterArray)

Performs validation and outputs specific data to the console

🔍 Key Features
✅ Create and manage student records dynamically

✅ Validate email address formats

✅ Calculate and display average days in course per student

✅ Filter students by degree program

✅ Remove students from roster by ID

✅ Clean, maintainable codebase designed for scalability
