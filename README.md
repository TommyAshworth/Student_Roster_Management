🧾 Student Roster System | C++
📌 Scenario
You are hired as a contractor to help a university migrate an existing student system to a new platform using C++ language. Since the application already exists, its requirements exist as well, and they are outlined in the next section. You are responsible for implementing the part of the system based on these requirements. A list of data is provided as part of these requirements. This part of the system is responsible for reading and manipulating the provided data.



You must write a program containing two classes (i.e., Student and Roster). The program will maintain a current roster of students within a given course. Student data for the program include student ID, first name, last name, email address, age, an array of the number of days to complete each course, and degree program. This information can be found in the “studentData Table” below. The program will read a list of five students and use function calls to manipulate data (see part F4 in the requirements below). While parsing the list of data, the program should create student objects. The entire student list will be stored in one array of students called classRosterArray. Specific data-related output will be directed to the console.

🛠️ Technologies & Concepts Used
C++

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Data Parsing

Dynamic Memory Management

Custom Classes

Console I/O

📚 Requirements Overview
The system is built using two main classes:

Student: Holds attributes like ID, name, email, age, course durations, and degree program.

Roster: Manages a class roster and provides functionality to interact with student data.

The application:

Parses student data from a structured dataset

Dynamically creates and stores Student objects

Maintains an array of students (classRosterArray)

Performs validation and outputs specific data to the console

🔍 Key Features
✅ Create and manage student records dynamically

✅ Validate email address formats

✅ Calculate and display average days in course per student

✅ Filter students by degree program

✅ Remove students from roster by ID

✅ Clean, maintainable codebase designed for scalability
